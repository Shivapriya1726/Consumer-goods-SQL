# Consumer-goods-SQL

This is my submission for #codebasics for  ad_hoc insights for consumer goods. 

Task:
Atliq Hardwares (imaginary company) is one of the leading computer hardware producers in India and well expanded in other countries too.
However, the management noticed that they do not get enough insights to make quick and smart data-informed decisions. They want to expand their data analytics team by adding several junior data analysts. Tony Sharma, their data analytics director wanted to hire someone who is good at both tech and soft skills. Hence, he decided to conduct a SQL challenge which will help him understand both the skills.

#What did I do in this project?

#My learnings from this project:
âž•I Learned and used various SQL concepts like CTEâ€™s, Group By, Aggregate functions, Joins, case, and Window functions.

âž• I thoroughly Studied the data for doing querying and analysis, Which is the main thing to do in your Analysis Project. Without Knowing our data it is impossible to conduct an analysis. 

âž• ad hoc analysis - It is a process designed to answer a specific business question by using company data.
